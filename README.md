Documentation: Data Scraping, Parsing, and Storage Process

##1. Overview
This document describes the process of scraping txt files and binary files, extracting/parsing relevant data, storing the parsed data in a database, and further processing it. The entire workflow is automated to run daily during off-peak hours using a scheduling mechanism.

#2. Process Flow
The data pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. File Scraping (Text and Binary)
2. Data Extraction and Parsing
3. Data Storage in Database
4. Further Data Processing and Storage
5. Scheduled Execution


#3. Detailed Steps
#3.1 File Scraping
Source: Files (either .txt or binary) are fetched from a designated source, such as a directory, external storage, or a remote server.
File Types:
.txt files: Contains human-readable data.
Binary files: Requires specific decoding/parsing method.
Tools: Python: modules: requests (for remote sources) and multiprocessing were used to automate fetching these files.

#3.2 Data Extraction and Parsing
Text Files:
Text files are read line by line or as a whole, depending on the data structure.
Use Python’s open() function to load the content and regular expressions (re) along with user-defined functions to extract relevant information.
Binary Files:
Binary files were parsed using a specific parsing mechanism written, (using struct in Python to unpack binary data, and custom functions were used for extracting metadata and specific binary-encoded values.
Validation: Data is validated to ensure that essential fields are correctly extracted, and any missing or corrupted data is handled with exceptions.

#3.3 Storing Data in the Database
Database Type: The parsed data is stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL/SQLite) and NoSQL database (MongoDB), depending on the structure and nature of the data.

Schema:
Design tables or collections based on the data extracted, ensuring proper indexing for efficient querying.
For relational databases, use SQLAlchemy, pandas’ .to_sql() method, or direct SQL queries to insert data.
For NoSQL, use libraries like pymongo for MongoDB to store the parsed data.
Transaction Handling: Ensure that data inserts are transactional, meaning if an error occurs mid-operation, the data consistency is maintained.

#3.4 Further Data Processing
Transformation: After storage, the data undergoes additional processing such as:

Aggregations
Filtering out irrelevant records and aggregating data.
Stored Procedures: Pre-defined database procedures can be triggered to process the stored data.

Reporting: After processing, reports may be generated for downstream systems or dashboards (e.g., using matplotlib or plotly for visualization).

#3.5 Scheduling
Frequency: The process runs daily during off-peak hours to ensure minimal load on resources.

Scheduling Mechanism:
Cron Jobs (bash): Set up a cron job to trigger the script at specific off-peak times.

####4. Error Handling
Logging: Implement robust logging mechanisms (e.g., using Python’s logging module) to capture:
Errors during file scraping (e.g., file not found, file permission issues)
Parsing errors (e.g., invalid format, unexpected content)
Database errors (e.g., connection issues, data insertion failures)
Retry Mechanism: In case of failures (e.g., network issues during file scraping or database connection errors), implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

#5. Monitoring and Alerts
Monitoring: Use monitoring tools (cron job logs)

#6. Security Considerations
Ensure that the files being scraped are from trusted sources.
Follow database security best practices such as using prepared statements, encrypting sensitive data, and ensuring proper user permissions.

#TODO: Implement a Live Webpage
To build a fully functioning web page for visualizing and providing statistics on the data.

#Summary
This data scraping, parsing, and processing pipeline was implemented and ran for 1 month (July 2024). The project provides a reliable and automated way to fetch, extract, and store important data from both text and binary files. The daily scheduling ensures regular updates, while error handling and monitoring mechanisms maintain system stability and alert for potential failures.
